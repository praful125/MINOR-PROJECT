Fingerprint Minutiae Extraction
INTRODUCTION

Looking towards the new digital era which has equally probable pros and cons, our electronically interconnected society, reliable and user-friendly recognition and verification system is essential in many
sectors of our life. BIOMETRICS is the science of uniquely recognising humans based on intrinsic physical
traits such as Fingerprints, Iris scan, Face detection, Speech recognition, Signature verification, DNA
testing etc. Fingerprint recognition is one of the most popular biometric techniques used in automatic
personal identification and verification.

➢ A fingerprint is a distinct pattern of ridges and valleys on the
finger surface of an individual. A ridge is defined to be a single
curved segment whereas a valley is the area between two
adjacent ridges. So, the dark areas of the fingerprint are
called ridges and white area that exists between them is
known as valleys.

➢ Minutiae can be defined as the points where the ridge lines
end or fork. So, the minutiae points are the local ridge
discontinuities and can be of many types.
 These types are –
 Ridge ending is the point where the ridge ends suddenly.
 Ridge bifurcation is the point where a single ridge branches out into two or more ridges
 Ridge dots are very small ridges.
 Islands are slightly longer than dots and occupy a middle space between two diverging ridges.
 Ponds or Lakes are the empty space between two diverging ridges.
 Spurs is a notch protruding from a ridge.
 Bridges are the small ridges that join two longer adjacent ridges.
 Crossovers are formed when two ridges cross each other.
 

➢ Minutiae points are the major features of a fingerprint image and are used in the matching of
fingerprints. These minutiae points are used to determine the uniqueness of a fingerprint image.
A good quality fingerprint image can have 25 to 80 minutiae depending on the fingerprint scanner
resolution and the placement of finger on the sensor.

➢ The uniqueness of a fingerprint is exclusively determined by the local ridge characteristics and
their relationships. The ridges and valleys in a fingerprint alternate, flowing in a local constant
direction. The two most prominent local ridge characteristics are: 1) Ridge ending and, 2) Ridge
bifurcation. A ridge ending is defined as the point where a ridge ends abruptly. A ridge bifurcation
is defined as the point where a ridge forks or diverges into branch ridges. Collectively, these
features are called minutiae.

Due to its distinctiveness, compactness, and compatibility with features used by human fingerprint
experts, minutiae-based representation has become the most widely adopted fingerprint
representation scheme.
